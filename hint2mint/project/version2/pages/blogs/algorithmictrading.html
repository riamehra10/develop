             <h1><b>How Algorithmic Trading is Changing the Indian Stock Markets</b></h1> 
             <h2>- By Kimaya Patil</h2>
             <img src="../../images/blogs/algorithmictrading/web2.png" height="450px" width="700px"><br>
             <p>The advent of Algorithmic Trading happened in India when, back in 2008, the Securities and Exchange Board of India
             (SEBI) allowed stockbrokers to offer Direct Market Access (DMA) to their clients. Since this change took place in
             the middle of a global recession (2008), it swept the entire banking and securities market.<br>
             So, what is algorithmic trading? In very simple terms, it involves the use of technology and programming to
             automatically buy or sell the securities. Normally, these tasks are performed by humans, tasks such as analysis of
             companies, sectors, businesses, prices, and other data. Then they decide when to buy or sell. But this data can be
             automatically analyzed by a computer as well, and that too in half the time.<br>
             At first, algorithmic trading was just used to perform simple tasks faster, like buying something on one exchange
             and selling it on another and capturing the difference as arbitrage profits. As time progressed, algorithms got more
             sophisticated and complex, using ‘futures’ or ‘options’ for creating profitable trades that enter and exit in
             milliseconds. Now, modern programs can place trades and manage diverse portfolios with minimal human supervision. In
             the vast forex markets, which run 23 hours a day, algorithms account for about 80% of the trade volumes. The cherry
             on the cake is that these algorithms could generate profits at a frequency and speed that is humanely impossible to
             reach.</p>

             sophisticated and complex, using ‘futures’ or ‘options’ for creating profitable trades that enter and exit in
             milliseconds. Now, modern programs can place trades and manage diverse portfolios with minimal human supervision. In
             the vast forex markets, which run 23 hours a day, algorithms account for about 80% of the trade volumes. The cherry
             on the cake is that these algorithms could generate profits at a frequency and speed that is humanely impossible to
             reach.
             </p>
             <p>
             Ever since then, exchanges have been making more and more changes to accommodate such automated trading. Even the
             brokerage industry has effectively lived up to these rapid changes. They have introduced easily understandable
             automated software, and have also provided interfaces (APIs) that could place orders for traders.
             It is expected that the global algorithmic trading market will grow significantly between 2018 and 2026, mainly
             because cloud-based services for algorithmic trading will start appearing in the markets, fuelled by the increasing
             demand for Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI helps algorithms adapt to the market conditions by learning from their
             past experiences, hence reducing risks while making trading decisions.<br>
             37% of financial institutions in India have invested in such technologies, and 68% plan on doing the same in the
             coming year, according to a survey conducted by Coherent Market Insights. The future of trading and dealing is in
             automation. Upcoming traders will be expected to have at least basic knowledge of how these algorithms function and
             how to use them.</p>
             <p>
             In the light of these advancements, some tough questions that need to be asked and answered are:
             <br><br>• Complex algorithms, at some point, will take over the Indian stock markets. Would it be fair for a few
             well-heeled market participants to secure undue advantages with the help of such technology?
             While it is clear that ‘fintech’ is the trend nowadays, it is just as easy to abuse this technology and to take
             things to the extreme, to set off something called predatory algorithms.
             What are predatory algorithms? They are algorithms that prey on other algorithms. For example, some might detect
             that a particular algorithm is selling a large stock in small bits and pieces. After detecting it, this predatory
             algorithm will take advantage by running ahead of it. Some algorithms might simply create artificial price signals
             to distort the design of some other algorithm. This had happened with a trader in London, where he spoofed over
             150,000 orders. This resulted in a major ‘flash crash’, where algorithms lost their footing, and the trader earned
             around $40 million. However, these trade orders were canceled immediately, hence nullifying the effects and
             stabilizing the markets.</p>
             <p>
             It is clear that technology is an opportunity, which, at least in finance, provides a direct link to profits. One
             can use it for the greater good: to involve more people, to reduce costs, and to save time. But one can use it for
             evil as well, and if they’re cunning enough, they might just get away with it. The real challenge for Indian stock
             markets will be to find an equilibrium between these sides of the coin, an equilibrium that is fair to all
             participants in the market.
